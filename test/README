This directory contains test cases for OCL expressions. You can test
the USE compiler and evaluation of expressions by typing `make
test'. The calculated results should match the expected output in the
files *.out. Differences to the expected results can be found in the
*.result files.

File format of *.in files:
--------------------------

These files are for testing parsing and evaluation of expressions. A
file `foo.in' is used to derive files `foo.cmd' and `foo.out'. The
first is a command file that can be read by USE. The second contains
the expected output. Lines starting with `#' in *.in files are ignored
as well as empty lines. All other lines not starting with a `*' are
taken as input for USE. Lines with a leading `*' mark expected output
(without the `*') from USE.
