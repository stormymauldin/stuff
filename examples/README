This directory contains some example specifications. You can test USE
by typing `make test'. This will do a syntax and semantic check on
each specification. Many of the case studies are not yet complete and
may contain experimental stuff.

Files that end with `-mm.cmd' are command files for producing a UML
metamodel instance of a model. They can be generated with `make
mm'. Then, try running
	
	use -v -nogui UML13All.use <model>-mm.cmd

and check whether <model> is a valid UML model by issuing a `check'
command at the prompt.
